# Permissions
I think in applications there are the following different permissions:

- Domain Permission
  - The object is in a state where a usecase can't be executed
  - eg: task is blocked and not allowed to be reopened
- Role based permissions
  - only a certain role is allowed to execute an action
    - only employees from department xyz can execute a usecase
- Querying data
  - is a user allowed to see a record
